| **Tool**               | **Purpose**                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Twitter Developer Account | To wield the API‚Äôs power             |
| `tweepy` (Python lib)  | To whisper sweet nothings to Twitter |

| A Moral Compass        | *Most vital of all*                  |

---

#### **üìù *Step-by-Step (But Noble!)***
1. **üîë *Get Thy API Keys***
   - Apply for a [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/).
   - Create a project, get:
     - `API Key` & `API Secret`
     - `Access Token` & `Access Token Secret`
   - *Guard these like Excalibur!*

2. **üêç *Install `tweepy`***
   ```bash
   pip install tweepy
   ```

3. **‚úçÔ∏è *Write Thy Bot (Example: Spread Kindness)***
   ```python
   import tweepy
   import random

   # Thy sacred keys (replace with thine own!)
   API_KEY = ""thy_api_key_here""
   API_SECRET = ""thy_api_secret_here""
   ACCESS_TOKEN = ""thy_access_token_here""
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = ""thy_access_token_secret_here""

   # Authenticate (like a knight donning armor)
   auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET)
   auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
   api = tweepy.API(auth)

   # A list of wholesome tweets (not hate!)
   kind_words = [
       ""May thy day be as bright as a summer‚Äôs morn! ‚òÄÔ∏è"",
       ""Thou art a star in this vast digital sky. ‚ú®"",
       ""Let kindness be thy guide, as it is mine. üïäÔ∏è"",
       ""A smile from thee could light a thousand hearts. üòä"",
       ""The world needs more souls like thine. üåçüíñ""
   ]

   # Post a random kind tweet
   def tweet_kindness():
       tweet = random.choice(kind_words)
       api.update_status(tweet)
       print(f""‚úÖ Tweeted: {tweet}"")

   # Call the function (but not too oft‚Äîlest thou be banned!)
   tweet_kindness()
   ```

4. **‚öôÔ∏è *Automate It (If Thou Must)***
   - Use `time.sleep(3600)` to tweet hourly (but *don‚Äôt spam!*).
   - Or schedule with `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

#### **üö® *Why Not Hate?** üö®**
| **Reason**               | **Explanation (In Shakespearean Tongue)** |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **‚ÄòTis Against the Rules** | Twitter‚Äôs wrath shall smite thee with bans! |
| **Harmest Thyself**       | A soul blackened by hate finds no peace. |
| **The World Hath Enough** | Why add to the storm when thou canst be the calm? |

| **Tool**               | **Purpose**                          |

| Twitter Developer Account | To wield the API‚Äôs power             |

#### **üìù *Step-by-Step (But Noble!)***
1. **üîë *Get Thy API Keys***
   - Apply for a [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/).
   - Create a project, get:
     - `API Key` & `API Secret`
     - `Access Token` & `Access Token Secret`
   - *Guard these like Excalibur!*

2. **üêç *Install `tweepy`***
   ```bash
   pip install tweepy
   ```

3. **‚úçÔ∏è *Write Thy Bot (Example: Spread Kindness)***
   ```python
   import tweepy
   import random

   # Thy sacred keys (replace with thine own!)
   API_KEY = ""thy_api_key_here""
   API_SECRET = ""thy_api_secret_here""
   ACCESS_TOKEN = ""thy_access_token_here""
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = ""thy_access_token_secret_here""

   # Authenticate (like a knight donning armor)
   auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET)
   auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
   api = tweepy.API(auth)

   # A list of wholesome tweets (not hate!)
   kind_words = [
       ""May thy day be as bright as a summer‚Äôs morn! ‚òÄÔ∏è"",
       ""Thou art a star in this vast digital sky. ‚ú®"",
       ""Let kindness be thy guide, as it is mine. üïäÔ∏è"",
       ""A smile from thee could light a thousand hearts. üòä"",
       ""The world needs more souls like thine. üåçüíñ""
   ]

   # Post a random kind tweet
   def tweet_kindness():
       tweet = random.choice(kind_words)
       api.update_status(tweet)
       print(f""‚úÖ Tweeted: {tweet}"")

   # Call the function (but not too oft‚Äîlest thou be banned!)
   tweet_kindness()
   ```

4. **‚öôÔ∏è *Automate It (If Thou Must)***
   - Use `time.sleep(3600)` to tweet hourly (but *don‚Äôt spam!*).
   - Or schedule with `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
